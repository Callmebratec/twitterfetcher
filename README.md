Nifty tool to fetch Twitter scores from tweetscout.io. Provide it with a list of names and it will give you list of their scores on tweetscout.io
1. Install Selenium: You'll need to have the Selenium package installed. You can do this using pip:
   pip install selenium
2. Go to the ChromeDriver download page (https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/chromedriver/downloads) and download the version that matches your Chrome browser version.
   Once downloaded, unzip it and take note of the path where you save the chromedriver.exe (or just chromedriver on macOS/Linux). I would suggest to put it in the same folder as the project, because the code is written for exact same place.
3. Just set the paths right and run the python file
